## 🎮 Game Description

<p align="justify">
<b>Merge In Universe</b> is a fun and addictive puzzle game that challenges players to merge planets and create an entire solar system — from tiny Mercury all the way to the mysterious Black Hole.
</p>

<p align="justify">
With intuitive drag-and-drop controls and realistic physics, your mission is to carefully drop planets, merge those of the same type, and avoid letting them stack too high or fall beyond the danger zone.
</p>

### ✨ Features

- 🚀 Simple drag-and-drop gameplay  
- 🌍 Merge planets to unlock new celestial bodies  
- 🌌 Realistic physics-based interactions  
- 🎨 Colorful visuals and smooth animations  
- 🔊 Satisfying sound effects and feedback
